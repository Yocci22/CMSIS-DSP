# CMSIS-DSP

Basic Problem

Design a DSP program using  STM32CubeIDE to process the chosen sensor data ( such as 3D accelerators or gyroscopes) from STM32 IOT Node development board.

Your DSP program can implement a low pass filter, like FIR example, or other algorithms, such as FFT, etc. Before testing real data, you should test the program using a known signal to show the correctness.
